    **this is a WIP feature that is still very buggy, don't attempt to use this, instead, use below! V**

    ?story @user - provides a list of all stories by that user
    ?story @user storyname - provides a viewing platform for that specific story
```
?createstory - allows a user to create a story in the individual parts
    usage as follows:

# Reminder

Please keep in mind this bot was programmed by two beginners in the space of 2/3 days. It is not the best, but it is a way for us both to learn the language, package manager and API wrappers we used. Above all we had a lot of fun on this project and will likely continue developing it after the Discord Hack Week.

Discord has a 1024 embed text limit, and a 2000 non-embed text limit, so please be weary that anything over 1024 characters will break! 

# Invite the bot to your own server + (To the judges of Hack Week) - You must invite this bot instead of downloading it, otherwise it will not connect to our SQL servers!
