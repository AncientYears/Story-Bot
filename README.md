# Reminder

Please keep in mind this bot was programmed by two beginners in the space of 2/3 days. It is not the best, but it is a way for us both to learn the language, package manager and API wrappers we used. Above all we had a lot of fun on this project and will likely continue developing it after the Discord Hack Week.
